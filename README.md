LeetCode Solutions
====================================================

### Introduction

LeetCode is a very good website to sharpen you programming/problem-solving skills. The idea to setup this repo
is inspired by [Haoel's repo](https://github.com/haoel/leetcode). However, Java is preferred here simply because
of personal preference. Of course, not all solutions are optimal and your suggestions and contributions are welcomed.
